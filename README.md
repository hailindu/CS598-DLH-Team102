## Environment
Our environment setup is straightforward and relies only on CPU processing for the initial run of 5 epochs.

We have attached the YAML file to ensure that anyone who wishes to test the code can set up an identical environment and package configuration.

## Data
The notebook we are running uses MIMIC-III database.

We are planning to transition to a cloud computing environment to process the entire dataset.

The complete dataset that we used can be found here:
[MIMIC-III Clinical Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)
